# daylight's scripts for Blutopia!

Scripts I use for Blutopia. Some are forked from the forums to fix or improve features, and some are reformatted for better readability. Enjoy!

## nord.css ([source](https://blutopia.cc/forums/topics/5951))

Just reformatted, nothing else.

1. Go into Settings -> External CSS Stylesheet
2. Paste the following URL:
